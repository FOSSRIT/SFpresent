Divvying up the paper
======================
Ok, so we all made approximately the same amount of slides. That being said, we know what it is that we did for this project. For example, I'll write about badges in the intro and conclusion, about failed school servers, and gettext translating.  If you each turn each slide you did into a paragraph or two, then we should have a solid amount of content. By that I mean turn one of the sentences from the slide into a topic sentence, and take what you would have said about it and just type those in as the body of each paragraph. We can and most definitely should put screenshots and code into the paper, but there shouldn't be more pictures than text. Sound decently professional with your writing, but what is most important is that you have proper grammar and explain what we did very thoroughly. Imagine that you weren't a part of this team, but rather someone who was interested in continuing the work, but the only reference they had was our paper. Our explanation of procedures, code, and functionality should be succinct and eloquent enough for the paper to provide enough information by itself.

For merge conflicts sake, I recommend that we each work on a document under our own name, and copy paste it all together when we're done, which should be in the very near future. I'll look over and edit work you guys type in, and add more fluff if necessary. I understand that we four are programmers and not writers, but that doesn't mean we are incapable of writing about what we did. If you have to, imagine that you're writing up a lab report for a science experiment. I'm sure we all had to do those.

I'm 90% sure that the paper is due friday, but that doesn't mean we have to stress out about it. If we all just type away at it, we should have a solid amount by the time we have leave on the plane, and I'll do editing and proofreading on planes and in airports, finishing it thursday night at the hotel if need be. I'm confident that we'll be able to do this, just slay it as you would code, the bigger it is the harder it'll fall.

-Fortnight
