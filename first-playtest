Lemonade Stand first playtest:
    When we first playtested Lemonade Stand we found a number of features that needed 
    to be changed or updated.

    Changes:
        -User interaction was a bit dull, in that the user had to completely focus on
            the game to see what was happening
        -User Interface needed some cleaning up becuase it was all text and had too
            much information that the user didnt need.

    Updates:
        -Art updates (background, localization, etc..)
        -User Interface Clean up 
        -Difficulty levels
        -Challenge mode
        -badges
        -Languages (localization)
