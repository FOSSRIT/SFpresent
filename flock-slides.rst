Mozilla Open Standards
=========================

- Badges are a digital representation of skills learned outside the classroom

- Four examples of emerging learners that could benefit from badges

    - Kareem the High school student who applies himself to extracurriculars instead of rigid school system

    - Sarah the freelance programmer who has been coding since middle school and now feels a college degree has nothing more to offer her

    - Jin the aspiring artist who has grown a stable following within her community but wishes to move to a new city

    - Antony the middle aged worker who has to find a new job in a field that has greatly changed from when he entered it

- Juan Carlos the peruvian student who has been given an XO Laptop from his school in his village in the mountains and aspires to learn and share all technology has to offer
