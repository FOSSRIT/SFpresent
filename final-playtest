New York, Sodus Central School STEM (S T E M):
    
    FOSS@RIT traveled to Sodus Central School to demo and playtest several different
    sugar activities that were developed this past summer.  We had a total of 14 
    XO OLPX laptops running the activities of Lemonade Stand and SkyTime.  Our 
    test group comprised of incomming 6th graders varying in age from 10 - 12.

    Order of playtesting:
        First a lesson in python was held by a SURF colleague to introduce programming to
        studtents at an early grade level.  During this time, FOSS@RIT members mentored
        and assisted the testers in solving errors and answering questions.

        SkyTime:
            After the lesson, we introduced SkyTime to discover that the game was a
            'little' too easy for the 6th grade level. Since SkyTime was targeted at
            2nd to 4th grade students this wasn't a surprise.  

        Lemonade Stand:
            Continuing with the Playtesting, we found that some students really
            caught onto the game and worked together with thier partners to fully 
            conquor how to play it. Other students were more interested in lunch than
            continuing to play around with educational video games.
            
            One thing we did learn was that the game has a high skill cap to actually
            play.  There was alot of instructing and guiding when the students first
            started to play the game.  We dont think that they grasped the concept of
            a tutorial level to learn how to play the game before they actually
            started playing it.
