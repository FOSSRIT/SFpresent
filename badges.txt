        -Working paper: https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf
            -The paper speaks of the importance of badges in a diverging digital age and what everyone can do to aid in the effort to expand Open Badges or how to benefit from the recognition and fulfillment the entire system has to offer. The report speaks of four examples of learners, showing a wide variety of ways badges can benefit people, organizations, and communities. Wether one struggling to apply their extracurricular successes in high school, looking to show one's skills outside of a college degree that has little to nothing to offer, planning on moving and needs a way to carry over their community of recognition and support with them, or in need of representing themselves for a new job in a workforce that has greatly changed since they entered it. The Badge framework allows for multiple levels of badges to exist, with more respectable badges only awarded through an application system to maintin their professionality. Lower level badges can represent one's interest or entry-level status in a field in a way that wouldn't otherwise be able to be represented in a profressional standard.

4. http://www.hastac.org/about
    -HASTAC was founded in 2002 by Cathy N. Davidson and David Theo Goldberg under the belief that whether or not the current structure of education is outdated, as techonology increases humanity gradually becomes more digital, which in turn creates a rift between traditional learning and the representation of acquired skills. To counter this, they stress an open source approach to defining a new, sustainable, and flexible approach to learning  application and recognition to match the evolving field of education. This approach is based on the input of all 9150 members of HASTAC. The information, events, and strategies on the site are posted by, commented on, and rated by a society of scholars dedicated to dissolve the border between the humanities and technology. The members of HASTAC hail from a variety of disciplines and degree levels, allowing for a broad plethora of viewpoints to consider as many points of view per subject considered as possible.
